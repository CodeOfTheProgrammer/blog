description: 'Are we in the future now?'
---

Welcome to the year 2020, and to my new blog.

When I was a kid I used to daydream about what things would be like in the future. Flying cars, space travel, and transporter technology should all have been commonplace by now. Well, here we are still driving our cars on the ground on Earth and walking around in a singular clump of extremely disappointed atoms.

Instead of becoming Captain of a starship I became a Software Developer, working in the corporate world until I recently escaped to work on my own projects. There are a lot of things I want to accomplish this year, and since New Years is all about setting new goals I thought I would share a few of mine:

-   Set up my new company, [Lionstooth Software](https://lionstoothsoftware.com).
-   Develop and release an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of my idea for a travel application by the end of March.
-   Find some people who want to use it.
-   Live healthier.
-   Remodel part of my house.

I think that's plenty to shoot for. I'll try to document my progress toward these goals in this blog.

I hope everyone has a very happy and prosperous 2020!

Eric
