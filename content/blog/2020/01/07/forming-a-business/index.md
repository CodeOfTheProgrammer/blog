Today I spent a lot of time researching options for forming my new business as an LLC. This is the company that I'll use to bootstrap my software ideas into (hopefully!) profitable Internet companies.

Some options that I considered:

-   Do it myself - Time-consuming and prone to mistakes.
-   Use a business Attorney - Unable to find good recommendations or ones that will handle everything for me.
-   Use a service - Convenient, comprehensive, affordable, tried-and-true.

In the end I chose to use ZenBusiness.com because they offer the services I wanted for a good price. They handle all the paperwork (e.g. operating agreement), act as the Registered Agent, request an EIN, submit renewals, etc.

[Lionstooth Software, LLC](https://lionstoothsoftware.com) should be completely formed by the end of the month!
