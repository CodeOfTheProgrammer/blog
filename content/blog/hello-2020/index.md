Welcome to the year 2020, and to my new blog. When I was a kid I used to think about what things would be like by now. Flying cars, space travel, and transporter technology should all have been commonplace by now. Well, here we are still driving our cars on the ground on Earth and walking around in a singular clump of atoms.

Instead of becoming Captain of a starship, I became a Software Developer. Recently I escaped the corporate environment to work on my own projects. This brings up a whole new set of goals to achieve. These are my goals for 2020:

* Set up my new company, [Lionstooth Software](https://lionstoothsoftware.com).
* Develop and release an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of my idea for a travel app by the end of March.
* Find some people who want to use it.
* Live healthier.
* Remodel part of my house.

I think that's plenty to shoot for. I'll try to document my progress in this blog. I hope everyone has a very happy and prosperous 2020!

Eric
