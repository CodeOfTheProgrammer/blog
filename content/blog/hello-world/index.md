Welcome to the year 2020, and to my new blog. When I was a kid I used to think about what things would be like by now. Flying cars, space travel, and that Star Trek transporter technology would definitely be perfected. Well, here we are still driving our cars on the ground and walking around in a singular clump of atoms. Instead of becoming a Space Ship Pilot I became a Software Developer and worked in the corporate world for many years.

Recently I escaped the corporate environment to work on my own projects! This brings up a whole new set of goals to achieve. I'll keep it short and sweet:

## Professional Goals

* Set up my new company, [Lionstooth Software](https://lionstoothsoftware.com).
* Develop and release an MVP of my idea for a travel app by the end of March.
* Find some people who want to use it.
* Document my progress in this blog.

## Personal Goals

* Live healthier.
* Remodel part of my house.
* Document my progress in this blog.

I think that's enough for now. I hope everyone has a very happy and prosperous 2020!

Eric
