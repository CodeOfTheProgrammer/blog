description: "How I set up my blog."

Today I'm working on setting up my blog (deployment, hosting, etc) and thought you might like to see my approach at a high level. My approach isn't the easiest from a technical perspective, but it gives me the flexibility I want, and hosting costs should be quite low.

I write the blog using the [Gatsby static site generator](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) in conjunction with the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) starter. I chose a static site generator because it allows me to write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), version control it in [git](https://git-scm.com/), and deploy it to any web server. I specifically chose Gatsby because I can leverage my Javascript and [React](https://reactjs.org/) experience to customize it. Gatsby supports interactive development (via `gatsby develop`) so that I can run the blog locally and see changes in my browser as I write content. The static web files (e.g. html, js) that we need to deploy to a web server can be created using `gatsby build`.

Every change to the blog is committed to [my Github repository](https://github.com/CodeOfTheProgrammer/blog), and I use [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) to automatically run `gatsby build`, deploy the blog, and invalidate the [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (Content Delivery Network) cache so readers visiting the blog will get the latest version rather than a stale version.

The blog is hosted in an [AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) handling the DNS (Domain Name System) lookup for `codeoftheprogrammer.com`. [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) handles TLS/SSL certificate and CDN caching.

The `codeoftheprogrammer.com` domain name is registered with [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/). I've had good experience with their support, and their prices are competitive.
